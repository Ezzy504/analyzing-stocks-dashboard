📊 Analyzing Stock Performance & Building an Interactive Dashboard
This project is part of my learning journey through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
It focuses on analyzing the stock performance and revenue trends of two prominent companies: Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using Python, yfinance, web scraping, and Plotly.

🚀 Objective
To understand and visualize how Tesla and GameStop's stock prices and quarterly revenues have evolved over time.
The final output is an interactive dashboard to showcase these trends using financial data sourced from the web.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
yfinance – to fetch historical stock price data
pandas.read_html() – to scrape revenue data from Macrotrends
Plotly – for interactive visualizations
Jupyter Notebook – to write and run the project

The dashboard contains:
📅 A historical line chart of stock prices for TSLA and GME
💰 A revenue trend plot extracted from Macrotrends
📊 Interactive plots with zoom, hover, and filtering features

🔍 Insights
Tesla (TSLA):
Tesla's stock shows strong growth since 2020, with a significant rise post-2020 due to increased EV demand and strong financial reports.
Revenue has shown steady quarter-on-quarter growth, aligning with its expansion into global markets.

GameStop (GME):
GameStop experienced extreme stock volatility in early 2021 due to the Reddit-driven short squeeze.
However, revenue trends do not reflect this hype, staying relatively flat or slightly declining, highlighting the disconnect between stock price and fundamentals.

📌 Key Learnings
Learned how to integrate multiple data sources (API + Web Scraping) in a data pipeline.
Understood the importance of visual storytelling in financial analysis.
Gained hands-on experience with Plotly, especially in building dynamic dashboards.

🧠 Future Enhancements
Add financial ratios (like P/E, EPS) for deeper analysis.
Include news sentiment analysis to correlate stock movement with headlines.
Build a Streamlit or Flask web app version of the dashboard for deployment.
